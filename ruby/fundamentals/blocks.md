## <a name='Blocks'></a>Blocks
### <a name='Thecollectmethod'></a>The collect method
The collect method takes a block and applies the expression in the block to every element in an array. Check it out:
```
my_nums = [1, 2, 3]
my_nums.collect { |num| num ** 2 }
# ==> [1, 4, 9]
```

If we look at the value of my_nums, though, we'll see it hasn't changed:
```
my_nums
# ==> [1, 2, 3]
```

This is because .collect returns a copy of my_nums, but doesn't change (or mutate) the original my_nums array. If we want to do that, we can use .collect! with an exclamation point:

```
my_nums.collect! { |num| num ** 2 }
# ==> [1, 4, 9]
my_nums
# ==> [1, 4, 9]
```
### <a name='Blocksandyielding'></a>Blocks and yielding

A block is simply a chunk of code, and yield allows you to "inject" that code at some place into a function. So if you want your function to work in a slightly different way, you don't have to write a new function, instead you can reuse the one you already have, but give it a different block.

For example, consider a function that will print the members of an Array, but number them, like this: if you give it ["apple","banana"], it should print
```
1. apple
2. banana
```
Easy enough, right? There are several ways to do this, but I'll just use each and a counter. Instead of incrementing the counter via += 1, I'd like to use the next method (you'll see why in a moment). Here's how the next method works: 3.next equals 4, 99.next is 100 and so on. So here's our method (without yield):
```
def print_list(array, first = 1)
  counter = first
  array.each do |item|
    puts "#{counter}. #{item}"
    counter = counter.next
  end
end
```
Now when we call print_list(["Ruby", "Python", "C"]), it'll print
```
1. Ruby
2. Python
3. C
```
The second parameter first is optional (it defaults to 1 because of the first=1 above) and it tells our function where to start counting:
```
print_list(["a","b","c"], 99)
```
will print
```
99. a
100. b
101. c
```
Because I chose next over += 1 to increment the counter, and because Ruby is really awesome, we can use strings instead of numbers to label the list items: "A".next is "B", and so forth. Thus
```
print_list(["Ruby", "Python", "C"], "X")
```
will print:
```
X. Ruby
Y. Python
Z. C
```
Great, right? But what if we wanted a different format for the item labels? Say, (1), (2), (3) instead of 1., 2., 3.? Our function does the formatting in this line:
```
puts "#{counter}. #{item}"
```
So instead of having two (almost identical) functions â€“ one for 1. 2. and one for (1) (2) (and so on, one for every possible idea), we're going to export that formatting thing into a block, and have just a yield inside the function:
```
# function print_list, line 4:
puts "#{yield counter} #{item}"
```
Now we can have a block handle the formatting:
```
print_list( [1,2,3], 23 ) { |n| "<#{n}>"}

# produces: 

<23> 1
<24> 2
<25> 3
```
Now I hope you see how this yield adds flexibility to your method. You can, for instance, have something like this:
```
print_list( ["alpha","beta","gamma"], 5 ) do |n|
  "[#{100*n}]:"
end
```
