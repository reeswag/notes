## <a name='WhatsaSymbol'></a>What's a Symbol?

You can think of a Ruby symbol as a sort of name. It's important to remember that symbols aren't strings:
```
"string" == :string # false
```

Above and beyond the different syntax, there's a key behavior of symbols that makes them different from strings. While there can be multiple different strings that all have the same value, there's only one copy of any particular symbol at a given time.

Symbols always start with a colon (:). They must be valid Ruby variable names, so the first character after the colon has to be a letter or underscore (_); after that, any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores is allowed.

Make sure you don't put any spaces in your symbol nameâ€”if you do, Ruby will get confused.
```
:my symbol # Don't do this!
:my_symbol # Do this instead.
```
### <a name='WhatareSymbolsUsedFor'></a>What are Symbols Used For?
Symbols pop up in a lot of places in Ruby, but they're primarily used either as hash keys or for referencing method names. (We'll see how symbols can reference methods in a later lesson.)
```
sounds = {
  :cat => "meow",
  :dog => "woof",
  :computer => 10010110,
}
```
Symbols make good hash keys for a few reasons:
+ They're immutable, meaning they can't be changed once they're created;
+ Only one copy of any symbol exists at a given time, so they save memory;
+ Symbol-as-keys are faster than strings-as-keys because of the above two reasons.

Converting between strings and symbols is a snap.
```
:sasquatch.to_s # ==> "sasquatch"
"sasquatch".to_sym # ==> :sasquatch
```
The .to_s and .to_sym methods are what you're looking for!

EG:
``` 
strings = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]
symbols = Array.new
strings.each do |s|
  symbols.push(s.to_sym)
end 
```
Besides using .to_sym, you can also use .intern. This will internalize the string into a symbol and works just like .to_sym:
```
"hello".intern # ==> :hello
```
When you're looking at someone else's code, you might see .to_sym or .intern (or both!) when converting strings to symbols.
