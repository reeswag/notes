## <a name='RulesforArrays'></a>Rules for Arrays

You use an array whenever you have something that matches the array data structure's useful features: 

1. If you need to maintain order. Remember, this is listed order, not sorted order. Arrays do not sort for you. 
2. If you need to access the contents randomly by a number. Remember, this is using cardinal numbers starting at 0. 
3. If you need to go through the contents linearly (first to last). Remember, that's what for-loops are for.

Then that's when you use an array
