# HTTP

HTTP is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it’s what makes the Web go round. This network protocol allows communication over the Internet between clients and servers. A client (such as a web browser) will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client. This response contains a status code (usually 200, which indicates that everything is okay), and the requested resource that’s usually in the form of a web page. The requests and responses are messages sent via HTTP. Figure 1.1 shows how that works.
