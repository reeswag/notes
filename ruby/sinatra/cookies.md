Cookies are small files that are saved locally on the userâ€™s computer. There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only last for the term of a session, and are deleted when the user closes the browser. Persistent cookies are kept after a session has finished, so can be used by the server in subsequent sessions.
