# Ajax

Reloading a whole page when only a small part of it has been updated is inefficient. This is because the whole page is returned from the server and reloaded, resulting in a poor user experience waiting for the page to refresh. Ajax can help us overcome this problem by loading content asynchronously in the background, so a page reload is unnecessary.

Ajax is a a standard technique used by web applications to create interactions that take place without page reloads.
