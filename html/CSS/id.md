# ID

In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.

There are several benefits to using id attributes: You can use an id to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.

id attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same id attribute.

One cool thing about id attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.

However, an id is not reusable and should only be applied to one element. An id also has a higher specificity (importance) than a class so if both are applied to the same element and have conflicting styles, the styles of the id will be applied.

```
#cat-photo-element {
  background-color: green;
}
```

Note that inside your style element, you always reference classes by putting a . in front of their names. You always reference ids by putting a # in front of their names.
