# Media Query

CSS Variables can simplify the way you use media queries.

For instance, when your screen is smaller or larger than your media query break point, you can change the value of a variable, and it will apply its style wherever it is used.

eg:

```  
@media (max-width: 350px) {
    :root {
      /* variable overide
    }
  }
```
