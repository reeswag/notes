# Accessible CSS

## .sr-only {}

CSS's magic can also improve accessibility on your page when you want to visually hide content meant only for screen readers. This happens when information is in a visual format (like a chart), but screen reader users need an alternative presentation (like a table) to access the data. CSS is used to position the screen reader-only elements off the visual area of the browser window.

Here's an example of the CSS rules that accomplish this:
```
.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  left: -10000px;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  top: auto;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
Note: The following CSS approaches will NOT do the same thing:

```display: none;``` or ```visibility: hidden;``` hides content for everyone, including screen reader users
Zero values for pixel sizes, such as ```width: 0px;``` ```height: 0px;``` removes that element from the flow of your document, meaning screen readers will ignore it.

## Contrast and Colour

Low contrast between the foreground and background colors can make text difficult to read. Sufficient contrast improves the readability of your content, but what exactly does "sufficient" mean?

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the strongest contrast. There are many contrast checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for you.

Color is a large part of visual design, but its use introduces two accessibility issues. First, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen reader users won't see it. Second, foreground and background colors need sufficient contrast so colorblind users can distinguish them.

Previous challenges covered having text alternatives to address the first issue. The last challenge introduced contrast checking tools to help with the second. The WCAG-recommended contrast ratio of 4.5:1 applies for color use as well as gray-scale combinations.

Colorblind users have trouble distinguishing some colors from others - usually in hue but sometimes lightness as well. You may recall the contrast ratio is calculated using the relative luminance (or lightness) values of the foreground and background colors.

In practice, the 4.5:1 contrast ratio can be reached by shading (adding black to) the darker color and tinting (adding white to) the lighter color. Darker shades on the color wheel are considered to be shades of blues, violets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter tinted colors are oranges, yellows, greens, and blue-greens.

There are various forms of colorblindness. These can range from a reduced sensitivity to a certain wavelength of light to the inability to see color at all. The most common form is a reduced sensitivity to detect greens.

For example, if two similar green colors are the foreground and background color of your content, a colorblind user may not be able to distinguish them. Close colors can be thought of as neighbors on the color wheel, and those combinations should be avoided when conveying important information.

Note: Some online color picking tools include visual simulations of how colors appear for different types of colorblindness. These are great resources in addition to online contrast checking calculators.
