# Lists

Unordered lists start with an opening ```<ul>``` element, followed by any number of ```<li>``` elements. Finally, unordered lists close with a ```</ul>```

For example:

```
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```
-------
HTML has another special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered lists.

Ordered lists start with an opening ```<ol>``` element, followed by any number of ```<li>``` elements. Finally, ordered lists are closed with the ```</ol>``` tag.

For example:
```
<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
  <li>Sylvester</li>
</ol>
```
