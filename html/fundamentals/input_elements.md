# Input Elements

input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user.

You can create a text input like this:
```
<input type="text">
```
Note that input elements are self-closing.

Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.

You can create placeholder text like so:
```
<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">
```
