# ES6

## Introduction

ECMAScript is a standardized version of JavaScript with the goal of unifying the language's specifications and features. As all major browsers and JavaScript-runtimes follow this specification, the term ECMAScript is interchangeable with the term JavaScript.

Most of the challenges on freeCodeCamp use the ECMAScript 5 (ES5) specification of the language, finalized in 2009. But JavaScript is an evolving programming language. As features are added and revisions are made, new versions of the language are released for use by developers.

The most recent standardized version is called ECMAScript 6 (ES6), released in 2015. This new version of the language adds some powerful features that will be covered in this section of challenges, including:

- Arrow functions
- Classes
- Modules
- Promises
- Generators
- let and const

Note: Not all browsers support ES6 features. If you use ES6 in your own projects, you may need to use a program (transpiler) to convert your ES6 code into ES5 until browsers support ES6.

## let vs var

One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can overwrite variable declarations without an error.
```
var camper = 'James';
var camper = 'David';
console.log(camper);
// logs 'David'
```

As you can see in the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James and then overridden to be David. In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem, but when your code becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.
A new keyword called let was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. If you were to replace var with let in the variable declarations of the code above, the result would be an error.

```
let camper = 'James';
let camper = 'David'; // throws an error
```

This error can be seen in the console of your browser. So unlike var, when using let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once. Note the "use strict". This enables Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. For instance:

```
"use strict";
x = 3.14; // throws an error because x is not declared`
```

When you declare a variable with the var keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.

The let keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

For example:

```
var numArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
// returns [0, 1, 2]
console.log(i);
// returns 3
```
With the var keyword, i is declared globally. So when i++ is executed, it updates the global variable. This code is similar to the following:

```
var numArray = [];
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
// returns [0, 1, 2]
console.log(i);
// returns 3
```
This behavior will cause problems if you were to create a function and store it for later use inside a for loop that uses the i variable. This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of the updated global i variable.

```
var printNumTwo;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
// returns 3
```

As you can see, printNumTwo() prints 3 and not 2. This is because the value assigned to i was updated and the printNumTwo() returns the global i and not the value i had when the function was created in the for loop. The let keyword does not follow this behavior:

```
'use strict';
let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    printNumTwo = function() {
      return i;
    };
  }
}
console.log(printNumTwo());
// returns 2
console.log(i);
// returns "i is not defined"
```

i is not defined because it was not declared in the global scope. It is only declared within the for loop statement. printNumTwo() returned the correct value because three different i variables with unique values (0, 1, and 2) were created by the let keyword within the loop statement.

## const

The keyword let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned.

```
"use strict";
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs"; // returns error
```

As you can see, trying to reassign a variable declared with const will throw an error. You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant. A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an underscore.

Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). In a later challenge you will see an example of a lowercase variable identifier being used for an array.

The const declaration has many use cases in modern JavaScript.

Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use let.

However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

```
"use strict";
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3]; // throws error, trying to assign a const
s[2] = 45; // works just as it would with an array declared with var or let
console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]
```

As you can see, you can mutate the object [5, 6, 7] itself and the variable s will still point to the altered array [5, 6, 45]. Like all arrays, the array elements in s are mutable, but because const was used, you cannot use the variable identifier s to point to a different array using the assignment operator.

### .freeze()

Const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Once the object is frozen, you can no longer add, update, or delete properties from it. Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected without an error.

```
let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
obj.newProp = "Test"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed
console.log(obj); 
// { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review:"Awesome"}
```
