# Basic JS

## Comments

Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using ```//``` will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:

```// This is an in-line comment.```

You can make a multi-line comment beginning with ```/*``` and ending with ```*/```:

```
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
```

#### Best Practice
As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.

## Declaring JS Variables

In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

```var ourName;```

creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.

```myVariable = 5;```

This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.
```
myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;
```

This assigns 5 to myVar and then resolves myVar to 5 again and assigns it to myNum.


When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

### Naming Variables

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

```MYVAR``` is not the same as ```MyVar``` nor ```myvar```. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

#### Best Practice
Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

Examples:
```
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;
```
-----

## Number

Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

```myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15```

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

```myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6```

We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

```myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169```

We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

Example

```myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8```

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

```i++;```

is the equivalent of

```i = i + 1;```

#### Note
The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

```i--;```

is the equivalent of

```i = i - 1;```

#### Note
The entire line becomes ```i--;```, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

#### Note
Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. 

The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

#### Example
```
5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
```

#### Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.
```
17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
```

#### Note
The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

### Compound Assignment

In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:
```
myVar = myVar + 5;
```
to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the ```+=``` operator.
```
var myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar); // Returns 6
```

Like the ```+=``` operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

The ```*=``` operator multiplies a variable by a number. 

The ```/=``` operator divides a variable by another number.

## String Variables

Previously we have used the code

```var myName = "your name";```

"your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

### Escaping within strings

When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.
```
var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
```
This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:

Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".

String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.
```
doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; 
singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';
```
The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. Another use for it would be saving an ```<a>``` tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string.
```
conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"';
```
However, this becomes a problem if you need to use the outermost quotes within it. Remember, a string has the same kind of quote at the beginning and end. But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error.
```
goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"'; // Throws an error
```

In the goodStr above, you can use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character. Note
The backslash ```\``` should not be confused with the forward slash ```/```. They do not do the same thing.

Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters:

To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage return.
To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.
We learned this in the previous challenge.
```
Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed
```

### Concatenating String

In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example
```
'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
```
#### Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

#### Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:
```     
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
// ourStr is now "I come first. I come second."
```

Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

```
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
// ourStr is now "Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?"
```

Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Example:
```
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
// ourStr is now "freeCodeCamp is awesome!"
```

### String properties

#### Length

You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

```"Alan Peter".length; // 10```

For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property.

#### Bracket Notation

Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using ```firstName[firstName.length - 1].```

You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the var firstName = "Charles" string by using ```firstName[firstName.length - 3]```

#### String Immutablility 

In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code:
```
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
```
cannot change the value of myStr to "Job", because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:
```
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";
```

## Array Variables

### Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

```var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];```

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

```[["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]```

This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.

#### Note
There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.

```
var ourArray = [50,40,30];
ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]
```

### Accessing multi-dimensional Array Elements

One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

```
var arr = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9],
  [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
];
arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]
arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11
```

### .push

An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

.push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.

Examples:
```
var arr1 = [1,2,3];
arr1.push(4);
// arr1 is now [1,2,3,4]

var arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
// arr2 now equals ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]]
```
### .pop

Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

.pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

Any type of entry can be "popped" off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.
```
var threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
var oneDown = threeArr.pop();
console.log(oneDown); // Returns 6
console.log(threeArr); // Returns [1, 4]
```

### .shift

pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

```
var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
var removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();
// removedFromOurArray now equals "Stimpson" and ourArray now equals ["J", ["cat"]].
```

### .unshift

Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

```
var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
ourArray.shift(); // ourArray now equals ["J", "cat"]
ourArray.unshift("Happy");
// ourArray now equals ["Happy", "J", "cat"]
```

## Functions

In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:
```
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: ```functionName();``` Each time the function is called it will print out the message "Hello World" on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

### Parameters

Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:
```
function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
```
Then we can call testFun: ```testFun("Hello", "World");``` We have passed two arguments, "Hello" and "World". Inside the function, param1 will equal "Hello" and param2 will equal "World". Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

### Global Scope and Functions
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with var.

### Local Scope and Functions
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.
```
function myTest() {
  var loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}
myTest(); // logs "foo"
console.log(loc); // loc is not defined
loc is not defined outside of the function.
```

### Global vs. Local Scope in Functions
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

In this example:
```
var someVar = "Hat";
function myFun() {
  var someVar = "Head";
  return someVar;
}
```
The function myFun will return "Head" because the local version of the variable is present.

### Return a Value from a Function with Return
We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example
```
function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}
var answer = plusThree(5); // 8
```
plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

### Undefined

A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example
```
var sum = 0;
function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}
addSum(3); // sum will be modified but returned value is undefined
```
addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

### Assignment

Everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:
```
ourSum = sum(5, 12);
```
will call sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to ourSum variable.

## Booleans

Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note
Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

### If

If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

#### EG
```
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
  if (wasThatTrue == true) {
      return "Yes, that was true";
    }
  return "No, that was false";
}
```

### Equality

There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

#### Type Coercion 

In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as "Type Coercion". Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:
```
1   ==  1   // true
1   ==  2   // false
1   == '1'  // true
"3" ==  3   // true
```
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

```
3 == '3'  // returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number
3 === '3' // returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed
```

### Inequality

The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. Strict inequality will not convert data types.

Examples
```
3 !==  3   // false
3 !== '3'  // true
4 !==  3   // true
```

### Greater Than

The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

### Less Than

The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.

The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. 

### The logical and operator (&&) 

Returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:
```
if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
```
will only return "Yes" if num is greater than 5 and less than 10. The same logic can be written as:
```
if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";
```

## Logical Or Operator
The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||).

The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:
```
if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
```

will return "Yes" only if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written as:
```
if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
```
## Else Statements

When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.
```
if (num > 10) {
  return "Bigger than 10";
} else {
  return "10 or Less";
}
```

If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.
```
if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}
```

### Logic Order

Order is important in if, else if statements.

The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.

Take these two functions as an example.

Here's the first:
```
function foo(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```
And the second just switches the order of the statements:
```
function bar(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```
While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.
```
foo(0) // "Less than one"
bar(0) // "Less than two"
```

#### EG 

```
var names = ["Hole-in-one!", "Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Go Home!"];
function golfScore(par, strokes) {
  // Only change code below this line
  if (strokes == 1) {
    return names[0];
  } else if (strokes <= (par - 2)) {
    return names[1]; 
  } else if (strokes == (par - 1)) {
    return names[2]; 
  } else if (strokes == (par)) {
    return names[3]; 
  } else if (strokes == (par + 1)) {
    return names[4]; 
  } else if (strokes == (par + 2)) {
    return names[5]; 
  } else {
    return names[6];
  }
}
```

### Boolean vs If/Else

Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:
```
function isEqual(a,b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:
```
function isEqual(a,b) {
  return a === b;
}
```

## Switch Statements

If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:
```
switch(lowercaseLetter) {
  case "a":
    console.log("A");
    break;
  case "b":
    console.log("B");
    break;
}
```
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

eg:

```
function caseInSwitch(val) {
  var answer = "";
  switch(val) {
    case 1:
      answer = "alpha";
      break;
    case 2:
      answer = "beta";
      break;
    case 3:
      answer = "gamma";
      break;
    case 4:
      answer = "delta";
      break;
  }
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);
```

In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.

A default statement should be the last case.
```
switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
}
```

### Default 
In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.

A default statement should be the last case.
```
switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
}
```
EG:

```
function switchOfStuff(val) {
  var answer = "";
  switch(val) {
    case "a":
      answer = "apple";
      break;
    case "b":
      answer = "bird";
      break;
    case "c":
      answer = "cat";
      break;
    default:
      answer = "stuff";
      break;
  }
  return answer;
}

switchOfStuff(1);
```

### Break

If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:
```
switch(val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}
```

Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained if/else if statements. The following:

```
if (val === 1) {
  answer = "a";
} else if (val === 2) {
  answer = "b";
} else {
  answer = "c";
}
```
can be replaced with:
```
switch(val) {
  case 1:
    answer = "a";
    break;
  case 2:
    answer = "b";
    break;
  default:
    answer = "c";
}
```

### Return

When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.

Example
```
function myFun() {
  console.log("Hello");
  return "World";
  console.log("byebye")
}
myFun();
```
The above outputs "Hello" to the console, returns "World", but "byebye" is never output, because the function exits at the return statement.

## Objects

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Here's a sample cat object:
```
var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
```
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as - "name", "legs", and "tails". However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:
```
var anotherObject = {
  make: "Ford",
  5: "five",
  "model": "focus"
};
```
However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.

### Object Properties

There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:
```
var myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2
```
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:
```
var myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};
myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj['More Space']; // Spock
myObj["NoSpace"];    // USS Enterprise
```
Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:
```
var dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};
var myDog = "Hunter";
var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"
```
Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected dynamically during the program execution, as follows:
```
var someObj = {
  propName: "John"
};
function propPrefix(str) {
  var s = "prop";
  return s + str;
}
var someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"
```
Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.

After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.

For example, let's look at ourDog:
```
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};
```
Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to "Happy Camper". Here's how we update his object's name property:

```
ourDog.name = "Happy Camper";
```
or 
```ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper";
```
 Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting "Camper", we'll get his new name, "Happy Camper".

 You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a "bark" property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";

Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, "bow-wow".

Example:
```
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
```

We can also delete properties from objects like this:

delete ourDog.bark;

Example:
```
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"],
  "bark": "bow-wow"
};

delete ourDog.bark;
```
